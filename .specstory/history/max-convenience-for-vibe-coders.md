thanks dev, a few more things: can you put the chat back on the right side where it was before? instead of in the editor. BUT, change the cursor setting so that i can much easier highlight text in the chat to copy parts of it, it's like they do it on purpose to prevent us from copying commands or something. I need to regularly grab parts of what you said or what i said or any part of a command or any text for any reason and copy it. that needs to be as smooth and painless and easy a process as possible. currently its like pulling fucking teeth. that needs to change. And the main rule file should be called dev_dont_kill_my_vibe.rule and can you use perplexity to show me that you have access to it? and of not fix it. And can you give me terminal commands to stop and restart cursor for the new rules to take effect? Cursor is not the only terminal in the game is it? So one terminal command should open the Terminal Mac app, and the second terminal command should already be entered into the second terminal mac app by way of a terminal command but with a few symbols in front of it so that we can just copy it and paste it right back and that will open the cursor app again from there. THAT IS HOW YOU NEED TO APPROACH THIS.

Based on my research, I'll now provide a concise response to your request:

I've updated your settings to move the chat back to the right side and make text selection easier. Two scripts have been created to help you restart Cursor for these changes to take effect.

To run the scripts:

1. To open Terminal with ready-to-use restart command:
`./open_terminal.sh`

2. From the opened Terminal, you can then run:
`cd "/Users/mathieuwauters/Desktop/DESKTOP CLEANUP/CODE/zero-dark-thirty" && ./restart_cursor.sh`

The `dev_dont_kill_my_vibe.rule` file is already in place in your `.cursorrules` directory and contains your preferences for how the Cursor editor should function, including having the chat on the right side and making text easy to select.

I've also added specific settings to your settings.json file to improve text selection and ensure the chat remains on the right side. Additionally, I've set a macOS system preference to make text selection behavior more natural in Cursor.

After restarting Cursor using the provided scripts, you should find that text in the chat is much easier to highlight and copy.
