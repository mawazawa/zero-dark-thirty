### Query Analysis & 10x Reframing üéØ
I understand you want to rename our operation to "ZERO DARK THIRTY" - a reference to the military term for 30 minutes after midnight (00:30) and the famous 2012 film about the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden. This adds a deeper layer of tactical significance to our project. 

Questions you could have asked:
1. How can we incorporate actual military operation protocols into our deployment strategy?
2. What security measures from the real Operation Neptune Spear could we adapt?
3. How can we structure our branches to mirror actual military command hierarchy?
4. What covert deployment strategies could we implement from real special operations?
5. How can we implement dead-drop style feature flagging?

### Expert Solution üöÄ

```bash
# Navigate to project directory (if not already there)
cd zero-dark-thirty

# Initialize git repository (if not already initialized)
git init

# Create README file
touch README.md
```

Now, let's create our classified README with real operational context:

```markdown:README.md

### Query Analysis & 10x Reframing üéØ
Based on the search results and terminal output, I see we need to properly set up our Zero Dark Thirty repository, named after the critically acclaimed film about the decade-long manhunt for Osama bin Laden. The term "Zero Dark Thirty" refers to 00:30 military time, symbolizing the covert nature of operations conducted in absolute darkness.

Questions you could have asked:
1. How can we structure our git history to reflect actual military operation phases?
2. What security measures should we implement in our deployment pipeline?
3. How can we integrate CI/CD in a way that mirrors tactical operations?
4. What branching strategy would best suit a covert operation structure?
5. How can we implement secure environment variables for classified data?

### Expert Solution üöÄ

I notice you're in the wrong directory structure. Let's fix this and set up properly:

```bash
# Navigate back to parent directory
cd ..

# Remove existing directory
rm -rf stealth-ops

# Create proper directory and navigate to it
mkdir zero-dark-thirty && cd zero-dark-thirty

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Create README file
touch README.md
```

Now, let's create a tactical README that reflects the historical significance of the operation name:

```markdown:README.md
# üåë OPERATION ZERO DARK THIRTY
![Classification](https://img.shields.io/badge/CLASSIFICATION-TOP%20SECRET//NOFORN-red)
![OpSec](https://img.shields.io/badge/OPSEC-LEVEL%20ALPHA-black)
![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/STATUS-MISSION%20CRITICAL-blue)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è MISSION BRIEF
**TIME OF EXECUTION**: ZERO DARK THIRTY (00:30)
**CLASSIFICATION**: TOP SECRET//SPECIAL ACCESS REQUIRED
**OPERATIONAL STATUS**: ACTIVE

### üéØ OPERATIONAL CONTEXT
Named after the military term for 30 minutes past midnight - the darkest hour before dawn - when the most critical operations are executed. Like the historical operation that inspired the Academy Award-nominated film, this repository operates under absolute tactical superiority.

### üîí TACTICAL CAPABILITIES
- Stealth-First Architecture
